This app allows the TvSettings application to be used without the 
Leanback launcher, which is only available as part of GMS.

TvSettings registers with the Leanback launcher, but not with the
standard Android launcher. As a result, TvSettings doesn't appear in
the app tray in non-GMS builds, and can not be invoked via the GUI,
only via console commands.

This app registers as 'Settings' with the standard Android launcher, and 
when invoked, fires an intent that starts the real TvSettings app.
