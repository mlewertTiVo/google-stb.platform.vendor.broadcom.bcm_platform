couple changes from the default code in refsw which appears to have gone unsupported...

1) remove <asm/page.h> inclusion from fb.c

2) remove 'test004' and 'test009' from tests.c as they rely on a module not available.



to use:

1) boot android but do not start nxserver, this will load up the nexus driver still.

2) insmod the framebuffer kernel driver.

3) run nxmini to initialize the minimum nexus platform.

4) run "fbtest -f /dev/graphics/fb0 -d <test>"
