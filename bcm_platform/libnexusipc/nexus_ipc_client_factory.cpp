 * Module Description:
 * This file contains an abstract factory implementation for creation of Nexus
 * IPC Clients of different types (e.g. NexusIPCClient, NexusNxClient).
 * Every client process needs to call the "getClient()" method of this class in
 * order to obtain an instance of the underlying Nexus IPC Client implementation.
